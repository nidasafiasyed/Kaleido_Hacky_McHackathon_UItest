Creating a UI module for our smart contract: https://github.com/AbhishaB/KaleidoHackathon/

We have created a smart contract GovtContract.sol to track the transactions that an agency might do. The goal of this smart contract is to hold the said agency accountable and to introduce transparency into its working.

The server is run on node.js using the command:

```node app.js```

After it starts listening on port 3000, deploy the contract.

Our smart contract is first deployed using the command:

```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/govtcontract/deploy | jq```

This initializes the initial budget allocated to be some value set in the contract's js file, GovtContract.js.

The smart contracts records pertinent details of the transaction, such as amount of expenditure, department, purpose, date, time and location. These details are recorded on the blockchain.

This is done using the command:

```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/govtcontract/set -d '{"value1":"5000","value2":"01","value3":"PowerTools","value4":"09/24/2018","value5":"03:27:00","value6":"27606"}' | jq```

The value parameters are the aforementioned details of the transaction.

This smart contract now takes the expenditure amount and subtracts it from the initial budget and assigns it to the remaining budget. For subsequent transactions, it subtracts the amount from the remaining budget.

The remaining budget value is also written to the blockchain. It can be obtained using the command:

```curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/govtcontract/get | jq```
